  </constraints>

  <interfaces>
**Build & Deployment Interface (npm scripts):**
- `npm run build` → TypeScript compile + Vite production build → outputs to /dist
  - Expected output: "✓ built in Xs" message, /dist folder created
  - Build time: ~25 seconds (tested in Story 6.1)
  - Bundle size: ~614 KB (~184 KB gzipped)
- `npm run preview` → Preview production build locally
  - Starts server at: http://localhost:4173
  - Use to verify build before deployment

**Netlify Deployment Interface (netlify.toml):**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200  # SPA routing (rewrite, not redirect)
```

**Netlify Platform Interface:**
- Authentication: GitHub OAuth
- Repository connection: Select "Exam - Smart Budget Application"
- Build settings: Base dir (smartbudget if monorepo), Build command, Publish dir
- Deploy trigger: Automatic on push to main branch
- Output: Production URL (e.g., https://smartbudget-deyvid.netlify.app)

**Vercel Deployment Interface (Alternative):**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```
Note: Vercel auto-detects Vite projects - may not need vercel.json

**Production Application Interface:**
- URL: https://<subdomain>.netlify.app or https://<subdomain>.vercel.app
- Protocol: HTTPS (enforced automatically)
- Routing: Client-side (React Router) via SPA redirects
- Data: LocalStorage (browser-based, no backend API)
- CDN: Global edge locations for fast asset delivery

**GitHub Repository Interface (for documentation updates):**
- README.md: Add production URL to:
  - Top section: `[Live Demo](https://...)` badge/link
  - Deployment section: Actual production URL with instructions
- GitHub Settings → About:
  - Website field: Production URL
  - Description: Mention "Live demo available"

**Performance Testing Interface (Lighthouse):**
- Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab
- Run audit: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
- Target: Performance score >80
- Metrics: FCP, LCP, TTI, TBT, CLS

**Deployment History Interface:**
- Netlify/Vercel dashboard shows:
  - List of all deployments with timestamps
  - Deployment status (Success, Failed, Building)
  - Build logs for each deployment
  - Rollback option to previous successful deployment
  - Deploy preview URLs (for PRs, if enabled)
  </interfaces>

    <ideas>
**Test Ideas Mapped to Acceptance Criteria:**

**AC-1 (Production Build Successful):**
- Run `npm run build` from smartbudget directory → Exit code 0
- Verify /dist folder created with index.html, assets/ subdirectory
- Check JavaScript files are minified (inspect file contents)
- Verify filenames have hashes (e.g., index-abc123.js)
- Measure bundle size (ls -lh dist/assets/ or check build output)
- Verify source maps generated (index-abc123.js.map files exist)
- Check build time <60 seconds (note timestamp in build output)
- Verify no TypeScript errors (tsc -b completes successfully)

**AC-2 (Local Production Preview):**
- Run `npm run preview` → Server starts at localhost:4173
- Open browser → Navigate to http://localhost:4173
- Test Dashboard: Summary cards display, pie chart renders, trend chart renders
- Test Add Transaction: Form loads, submit creates transaction
- Test Edit Transaction: Click edit icon, form populates, save updates transaction
- Test Delete Transaction: Click delete, confirm, transaction removed
- Test Period Filter: Select "Last Month" → Transactions filter correctly
- Test Category Filter: Select category → Transactions filter correctly
- Test Search: Type in search box → Transactions filter by description
- Test Navigation: Click Dashboard, Transactions links → Pages load
- Test LocalStorage: Add transaction, refresh page → Data persists
- Check browser console → No errors
- Test responsive: Resize browser window → Layout adjusts correctly

**AC-3 (Hosting Platform Configured):**
- Create Netlify account → Account dashboard accessible
- Connect GitHub → OAuth flow completes, repositories visible
- Select repository → "Exam - Smart Budget Application" selected
- Configure base directory → "smartbudget" (if monorepo) or blank
- Set build command → "npm run build" or "cd smartbudget && npm run build"
- Set publish directory → "dist" or "smartbudget/dist"
- Set Node version → 20.x (if option available)
- Verify netlify.toml detected → Build settings auto-populated
- Enable automatic deploys → "Deploy on push to main" enabled
- Save configuration → Settings saved successfully

**AC-4 (Initial Deployment Successful):**
- Trigger deployment → Click "Deploy site" or push to main
- Monitor deployment → Dashboard shows "Building" status

- Wait for completion → Status changes to "Published" (target: <5 min)
- Copy production URL → e.g., https://smartbudget-deyvid.netlify.app
- Click production URL → Application loads (initial smoke test)
- Check deployment status → No errors, success message displayed

**AC-5 (Application Functions in Production):**
- Open production URL in browser → Application loads
- Verify HTTPS → URL starts with https://
- Test all features (same as AC-2 but on production URL):
