## Project information

### Brief
Build a fully functional web application that helps users manage their personal finances - SmartBudget.
The goal is to apply the BMAD methodology throughout the entire development process and use Claude Code or OpenAI Codex as AI-assisted tools during coding, debugging, and documentation.
This project should demonstrate how an AI-First Developer uses structured agile thinking (BMAD) and AI assistance to produce clean, functional, and maintainable software.
### Project Description
Create a Smart Budget Application that allows users to manage their personal finances. The app should demonstrate your understanding of BMAD methodology.
The application should allow users to:
- Add income and expense records.
- Categorize transactions (e.g., Rent, Salary, Transport).
- Display summaries and visual charts of spending.
- (Optional) Get AI-based suggestions for budget optimization.


### Requirements
1. BMAD Method Application
The project must follow the four phases of the Breakthrough Method for Agile Development (BMAD): Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, Implementation
2. Chat History
Save all your prompts in an md file (you can instruct your model to make it for you) prompts.md. The file should contain all your instructions, given to the model, ordered in chronological order.
3. GIT Repository
Save your work in a public GitHub repo. Make sure you create the repository from the very beginning of your work, before installing BMAD. Use clear git convention and commit each progress of the phases.
4. Summary.md

Add a summary.md in your repo. In the file write:
Which tasks you used Claude/Codex for
What output you accepted or modified
How AI affected your speed or code quality
What custom settings have you made (if any)
What problems you`ve handled during the development

### Delivery
Upload link to your repository in Classroom.
A README with brief and instructions on how to run the app should be included.



## Extra information

The Project information section above is the brief information about the project I was given.
It contains stuff which are relevant for the development of the projects and stuff which are only relevan to me afterwards (like Summary.md file information).
Everything which you can do as an AI you will do. Everything which you can help me with, you will introduce into the workflow. Example: every agent should store the prompts I give them into prompts.md file. Identify any other potential helpful things to add.

This is a small project. Do not overcomplicate it.
